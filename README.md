Repository for the "Topics in Particle Physics and Astroparticles II" course from IST.

This will contain all of the content provided by the teachers for the classes, such as templates and small tutorials.

Submissions of the students' work will also be done through this repository.

## ROOT Basics

If this is the first time you are using ROOT you can look at Template_0.ipynb, which reads zjet.root.

zjet.ROOT is a very simple root file where all the variables that we need to access have a corresponding branch, and where all entries
In the case of the variable being of the type vector, check what its dimensions are.





## ROOT Fitting real data from CMS



If you wish to utilize C++ there is a dimuon class created by LIP personel with code analogous to the one presented in Template_ROOFit.ipynb, that can be found at "https://github.com/aboletti/LIP-analysis-tutorial".
