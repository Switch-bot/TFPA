Repository for the "Topics in Particle Physics and Astroparticles II" course from IST.

This will contain all of the content provided by the teachers for the classes, such as templates and small tutorials.

Submissions of the students' work will also be done through this repository.

## ROOT Basics

If this is the first time you are using ROOT you can look at Template_0.ipynb, which reads zjet.root.

zjet.ROOT is a very simple root file where all the variables that we need to access have a corresponding branch.

The goal with this file is to get used to the basic functionalities of ROOT: How to read a file, how to check what is inside, and in the case of the dimensions not being explicit, what can we do with it.


## ROOT Fitting real data from CMS

The next step is to utilize slightly more complex files, with data that is saved in a realistic format.




If you wish to utilize C++ there is a dimuon class created by LIP personel with code analogous to the one presented in Template_ROOFit.ipynb, that can be found at "https://github.com/aboletti/LIP-analysis-tutorial".
